**GalaxyCreator**

GalaxyCreator is a browser-based interactive project that lets users visually generate and explore custom galaxies. It combines a simple user interface with dynamic space visuals, offering an engaging experience that showcases procedural design and frontend animation.

1. Overview

GalaxyCreator is implemented using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and runs entirely in the browser. The interface allows users to experiment with galaxy creation parameters and watch the generated results in real time.

Key components include:

Interactive galaxy rendering powered by JavaScript

Responsive layout for visual display

Clean and minimal styles for user focus

2. Features

Procedural generation of galaxy visuals

Configurable parameters for galaxy shape and appearance

Standalone static webpage with no server dependency

Easy to fork and extend for personal experimentation

3. Development

The project structure is straightforward:

/

├── img/              # Visual assets used in the page

├── scripts/          # JavaScript logic for galaxy generation

├── index.html        # Main entry point

├── style.css         # Visual styling

└── README.md         # This documentation


If you are exploring or extending the project:

JavaScript logic lives under scripts/

Styling tweaks can be made in style.css

Static assets are in img/

You can open the project in any editor and refresh your browser to see live changes.
